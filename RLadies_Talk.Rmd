# Outline of discussion

1. A little about me

1. Open and reproducible science

1. Open data science tools for coral reefs
 
1. Using Art to communicate science

1. How can we better merge data science with coral reef conservation?

My research is focused on better understanding how anthropogenic stressors interact with the natural variability of the oceans and affect individual to ecosystem-level processes.

## Open and reproducbile data science for coral reefs

.center[
*I firmly believe that an important step towards protecting coral reefs is to uphold reproducible data science practices and to share resources.*

# Reproducibility - what is it?

--
 
### “U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF) subcommittee on replicability in science: ‘reproducibility refers to the **ability of a researcher to duplicate the results of a prior study using the same materials as were used by the original investigator.'**”

# Types of reproducibility

.foot-note[From Victoria Stodden (as summarized in the ROpenSci Reproducibility Guide)] 

“**Computational reproducibility**: when detailed information is provided about code, software, hardware and implementation details.”

--

“**Empirical reproducibility**: when detailed information is provided about non-computational empirical scientific experiments and observations. In practise this is enabled by making data freely available, as well as details of how the data was collected.”

--

“**Statistical reproducibility**: when detailed information is provided about the choice of statistical tests, model parameters, threshold values, etc. This mostly relates to pre-registration of study design to prevent p-value hacking and other manipulations.”

---
# Is this how you have been working?

 ### If so, that's ok! Let's learn together.

# What about this workflow makes it hard to reproduce?

 
 ![ExcelWord](libs/Images/excelword.png)
 
---
# A few areas for improvement

--

- No clear or organized history of what’s been done to the data from raw data through final figures/results  

--

- Lack of comments/annotation describing the steps  

--

- Tedious & time consuming for a collaborator to recreate the analyses 

--

- Backed up w/version control? Probably not…  

--

- How do we transfer this into a final report or presentation? Is that reproducible?

# Why does this matter?

Say I’ve been **arrested for a murder** that was committed 6 months ago. My attorney says its very important to remember exactly what I did on the day of the murder to establish an alibi. I try my best to remember, and come up with this diagram describing my day:

# Open Science

.center[
### *"Open science is not just about improving the way we share data and methods; it is also about improving the way we think, work and interact with each other. It’s about technology enabling social infrastructure that can promote inclusivity to create kinder science."*]

# Open Science

## One scientist can only do so much  
- More data = more Power

--

## Science must be reproducible  

--

## Who paid for this data collection? 
- If on federal or state grant then the tax payers paid for your data
